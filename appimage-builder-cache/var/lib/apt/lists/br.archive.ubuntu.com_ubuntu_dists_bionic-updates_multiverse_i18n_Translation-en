Package: boinc-virtualbox
Description-md5: 690093958a0070907b98b36b21fb062c
Description-en: metapackage for virtualbox-savvy projects
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 Regular users (righteously) often find it an unbearable nuisance to
 care for the exact configuration of BOINC for virtualbox-based projects.
 This package adds a series of dependencies from the contrib
 section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this binary
 package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.

Package: broadcom-sta-common

Package: broadcom-sta-dkms
Description-md5: 4c9c20d84937e0293fe598f44d785bce
Description-en: dkms source for the Broadcom STA Wireless driver
 Broadcom STA is a binary-only device driver to support the following IEEE
 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network cards: BCM4311-, BCM4312-, BCM4313-,
 BCM4321-, BCM4322-, BCM43142-, BCM43224-, BCM43225-, BCM43227-, BCM43228-,
 BCM4331-, BCM4360-, and BCM4352-based hardware.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the wl kernel modules and makes use
 of the DKMS build utility to install them for the running kernel. The
 alternative package broadcom-sta-source can be used instead in case of build
 problems.
 .
 The wireless-tools package is also required in order to make use of these
 modules. Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

Package: browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash
Description-md5: efb8cdb83d2a1db04174dfb14143ebd9
Description-en: PPAPI-host NPAPI-plugin adapter for pepperflash
 The main goal of the project is to get PPAPI (Chrome) plugins
 working in Firefox (and any other web-browser supporting NPAPI plugins).
 It implements a wrapper which behaves like
 browser to PPAPI plugin and implements NPAPI plugin interface
 for browser to use.
 .
 This particular implementation doesn't implement any sandboxing,
 which means any malicious code can break through plugin security
 as there are no additional barriers.  This is the same level of security as
 NPAPI Flash have.
 .
 Flash plugin for Linux provided by adobe stopped at version 11.2; for
 chrome/chromium users there is pepperflash plugin but it's not supported by
 firefox/iceweasel/other browsers.
 .
 This package allows one to use the Pepper Flash plugin from Chrome
 in NPAPI web browsers.
