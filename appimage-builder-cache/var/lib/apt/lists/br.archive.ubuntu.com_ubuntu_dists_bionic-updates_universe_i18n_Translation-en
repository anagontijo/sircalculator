Package: aidl
Description-md5: 45859dc0b2ae5ed979acc57a859674e5
Description-en: Binder generator of AIDL interfaces
 aidl is a utility to generate Java and/or C++ code from Android's
 Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL). AIDL is similar to
 other IDLs you might have worked with. It allows you to define the
 programming interface that both the client and service agree upon in
 order to communicate with each other using interprocess communication
 (IPC). On Android, one process cannot normally access the memory of
 another process. So to talk, they need to decompose their objects
 into primitives that the operating system can understand, and
 marshall the objects across that boundary for you. The code to do
 that marshalling is tedious to write, so Android handles it for you
 with AIDL. This package provides two tools:
 .
   * "aidl" which generates Java bindings.
   * "aidl-cpp" which generates C++ bindings.
 .

Package: android-libboringssl
Description-md5: cd475d5105e77faeb7ea4e52f14b0a97
Description-en: Google's internal fork of OpenSSL for the Android SDK
 The Android SDK builds against a static version of BoringSSL,
 Google's internal fork of OpenSSL.  This package should never be used
 for anything but Android SDK packages that already depend on it.
 .
 BoringSSL arose because Google used OpenSSL for many years in various
 ways and, over time, built up a large number of patches that were
 maintained while tracking upstream OpenSSL. As Google’s product
 portfolio became more complex, more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and
 the effort involved in maintaining all these patches in multiple
 places was growing steadily.
 .
 This is the Android AOSP fork of BoringSSL which is designed to be
 used by Android and its SDK.  BoringSSL is only ever statically linked
 into apps, and pinned to a commit version.  Upstream has no official
 releases of BoringSSL on its own, so it must be included separately
 for each project that uses it.

Package: apksigner
Description-md5: 084b3acff7be60dc94f8caedfe355b64
Description-en: command line tool to sign and verify Android APKs
 apksig is a project which aims to simplify APK signing and checking
 whether APK's signatures should verify on Android. apksig supports
 JAR signing (used by Android since day one) and APK Signature Scheme
 v2 (supported since Android Nougat, API Level 24).
 .
 The key feature of apksig is that it knows about differences in APK
 signature verification logic between different versions of the
 Android platform. apksig can thus check whether a signed APK is
 expected to verify on all Android platform versions supported by the
 APK. When signing an APK, apksig will choose the most appropriate
 cryptographic algorithms based on the Android platform versions
 supported by the APK being signed.
 .
 apksigner command-line tool offers two operations:
 .
  * sign the provided APK so that it verifies on all Android platforms
 supported by the APK. Run apksigner sign for usage information.
 .
  * check whether the provided APK's signatures are expected to verify
 on all Android platforms supported by the APK. Run apksigner verify
 for usage information.
 .
 The tool determines the range of Android platform versions (API
 Levels) supported by the APK by inspecting the APK's
 AndroidManifest.xml. This behavior can be overridden by specifying
 the range of platform versions on the command-line.

Package: boinc

Description-en: metapackage for the BOINC client and the manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 This package depends both on the BOINC core client program that is
 required to participate in any project that uses BOINC, and the
 BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and control utility for the
 BOINC core client.

 projects.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC core client program that is required
 to participate in any project that uses BOINC. A central server
 distributes work units and collects results via this client. When
 attaching a local machine to a project, this client will also
 dynamically download the scientific data and executables to be then
 wrapped by the BOINC core client.

 .
 Regular users (righteously) often find it an unbearable nuisance to

Package: boinc-manager
Description-md5: 18cdf3bcfd01c25a71225cc0291571cd
Description-en: GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
 control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
 overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
  * attached projects
  * running tasks
  * file transfers between the client and project servers
  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
  * constraints on CPU usage
 The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
 it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
 in which all information and all control elements are available.
 .
 For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
 boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
 machine contributing.

Package: boinc-screensaver

 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
 manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
 available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
 some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
 a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
 with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
 saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
 again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
 the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
 the manager.
 .
 This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
 effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
 Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
 it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
 processes running on the same core.

Package: busybox
Description-md5: b7707908219c331294f3f9e8d926a9dc
Description-en: Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

Package: busybox-syslogd
Description-md5: 6d204aacbcadc9711030ab99f904ca3b
Description-en: Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox
 The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of
 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as
 well as from remote hosts.
 .
 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system
 messages.
 .
 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on
 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it
 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs
 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer
 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.
 .
 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be
 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and
 scripts.

Package: bwa
Description-md5: 7b904940a9f5331affa84d4b72dedb30
Description-en: Burrows-Wheeler Aligner
 BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against
 a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of
 three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first
 algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while
 the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM
 and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split
 alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended
 for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM
 also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina
 reads.

Description-en: Lisp dialect for the JVM
 Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual
 Machine. It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the
 approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with
 an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.
 Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode,
 yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is
 supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java
 frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that
 calls to Java can avoid reflection.
 .
 Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data
 philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a
 functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable,
 persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers
 a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that
 ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.

Package: cloud-initramfs-growroot
Description-md5: 2a0d4bed7bada9873cf69d658abe0c23
Description-en: automatically resize the root partition on first boot
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed, the initramfs will repartition a disk to make the
 root volume consume all space that follows it.
 .
 You most likely do not want this package unless you know what you are
 doing.  It is primarily interesting in a virtualized environment when
 a disk can provisioned with a size larger than its original size.
 In this case, with this package installed, you can automatically use
 the new space without requiring a reboot to re-read the partition table.

Package: cloud-initramfs-rescuevol
Description-md5: bd1aa20bccdfa138c49bcdbb3244b5c9
Description-en: boot off a rescue volume rather than root filesystem
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed the initramfs will check to see if any partitions
 with a label of 'RESCUE_VOL' are attached.  If such a volume is attached,
 it will boot off that volume rather than the root volume.
 .
 This is useful in a cloud environment, when the user is able to attach
 and detach volumes to a running system, but has no other mechanism
 for interupting of fixing a failed boot.  It is analogous to inserting
 a rescue CD into a system to recover from failure.

 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Description-md5: 4eec63ec6a45894436866732b96c2698
Description-en: Fix non-ANSI header files
 FixIncludes was created to fix non-ANSI system header files. Many
 system manufacturers supply proprietary headers that are not ANSI compliant.
 The GNU compilers cannot compile non-ANSI headers. Consequently, the
 FixIncludes shell script was written to fix the header files.
 .
 Not all packages with header files are installed on the system, when the
 package is built, so we make fixincludes available at build time of other
 packages, such that checking tools like lintian can make use of it.

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Package: ges1.0-tools
Description-md5: c59e8d2cae5d7d4114d74760a82cde3f
Description-en: Tools for use with the GStreamer editing services
 The GStreamer multimedia framework and the accompanying NLE set of
 plugins for non-linear editing offer all the building blocks for:
 * Decoding and encoding to a wide variety of formats, through all the
   available GStreamer plugins.
 * Easily choosing segments of streams and arranging them through time
   through the NLE set of plugins.
 But all those building blocks only offer stream-level access, which
 results in developers who want to write non-linear editors to write a
 consequent amount of code to get to the level of non-linear editing
 notions which are closer and more meaningful for the end-user
 (and therefore the application).
 .
 The GStreamer Editing Services (GES) aims to fill the gap between
 GStreamer/NLE and the application developer by offering a series
 of classes to simplify the creation of many kind of editing-related
 applications.

 This package contains command-line tools for GStreamer editing

Description-en: GObject introspection data for the GES library
 The GStreamer multimedia framework and the accompanying NLE set of
 plugins for non-linear editing offer all the building blocks for:
 * Decoding and encoding to a wide variety of formats, through all the
   available GStreamer plugins.
 * Easily choosing segments of streams and arranging them through time
   through the NLE set of plugins.
 But all those building blocks only offer stream-level access, which
 results in developers who want to write non-linear editors to write a
 consequent amount of code to get to the level of non-linear editing
 notions which are closer and more meaningful for the end-user
 (and therefore the application).
 .
 The GStreamer Editing Services (GES) aims to fill the gap between

 of classes to simplify the creation of many kind of editing-related
 applications.

 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides the git cvsimport, cvsexportcommit, and cvsserver
 tools, which allow Git to read from and write to CVS repositories and
 offer access over CVS protocol to Git repositories.
 .
 The git cvsimport tool can incrementally import from a repository that
 is being actively developed and only requires remote access over CVS
 protocol. Unfortunately, in many situations the import leads to
 incorrect results. For reliable, one-shot imports, cvs2git from the
 cvs2svn package or parsecvs may be a better fit.

 git-daemon, as provided by the git package, is a simple server for git
 repositories, ideally suited for read-only updates, i.e. pulling from git
 repositories through the network.  This package provides a runit service
 for running git-daemon permanently.  This configuration is simpler and
 more reliable than git-daemon-sysvinit, at a cost of being less
 familiar for administrators accustomed to sysvinit.

 This package provides two modules for integration with Emacs:
 .
  * git.el:
 .
    Status manager that displays the state of all the files of the
    project and provides easy access to the most frequently used git
    commands. The user interface is intended to be similar to the
    pcl-cvs mode. It can be started with `M-x git-status'.
 .
  * git-blame.el:
 .
    Emacs implementation of incremental "git blame".  When you turn it
    on while viewing a file, the editor buffer will be updated by
    setting the background of individual lines to a color that reflects
    which commit it comes from.
 .
 This package does not contain the VC-mode backend for git. That is
 part of standard Emacs distributions, starting with version 22.2.
 .
 For a more polished Emacs interface for Git, see the magit package.

Description-en: Gradle plugin to use Java annotation processors
 This plugin does a few things to make it easier/safer to use Java annotation
 processors in a Gradle build:
 .
   * it ensures the presence of configurations for your compile-time only
     dependencies (annotations, generally) and annotation processors,
     consistently across all supported Gradle versions;
   * automatically configures the corresponding JavaCompile and GroovyCompile
     tasks to make use of these configurations, when the java or groovy plugin
     is applied;
   * automatically configures IntelliJ IDEA and/or Eclipse when the
     net.ltgt.apt-idea or net.ltgt.apt-eclipse plugins are applied.

Package: graphicsmagick
Description-md5: 49dce754c724afc2a734936e7250be4b
Description-en: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

Package: graphicsmagick-dbg
Description-md5: fcc436d75960b67f4f57213c969230ff
Description-en: format-independent image processing - debugging symbols
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the
 C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these
 symbols.

 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or

 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer
 programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be
 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
 .
 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only
 tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of
 ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.
 .
 This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl
 libraries.

Package: hedgewars
Description-md5: 95a283ed5766101c57cbbde0d1b67a66
Description-en: Funny turn-based artillery game, featuring fighting hedgehogs!
 Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the
 course of the game, players take turns with one of their
 hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are
 available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
 winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a
 variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
 using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to
 move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
 to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
 thinking or moving.
 .
 A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
 during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee,
 Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine,
 Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause
 explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks.
 The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a
 restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when
 it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or
 through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either
 side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from
 contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the
 attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is
 shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

Package: lastpass-cli
Description-md5: 09db552a7aaade4cdf8cb8ecddada1e6
Description-en: command line interface to LastPass.com
 This application is a command line interface to the LastPass.com services. It
 brings both better security and convenience by allowing you to access, add,
 modify, and delete entries in your online LastPass vault, all from the
 terminal. You can also generate passwords for every server you use and
 securely store those passwords directly in LastPass. LastPass Enterprise
 features are supported as well, including Shared Folders.
 .
 Users who prefer the command line can access their data directly with “lpass
 ls” then using “lpass show -c --password Sitename” to put the Sitename
 password on the copy buffer. You can utilize “lpass show” to store passwords
 used in scripts, rather than putting passwords in the scripts themselves.
 LastPass can also be used as you work within the command line to help you
 login to servers. We’ve included some example scripts below.
 .
 The new tool is beneficial for LastPass users who want to use the command
 line to login to other machines as they work. There are examples such as
 contrib/examples/change-ssh-password.sh which shows automated password
 changing on a server. You could run it automatically on a nightly basis,
 regularly changing the password on the server as a security measure.

 clone. It uses a different grammar syntax which is designed to reduce
 the number of coding errors. Lemon also uses a more sophisticated
 parsing engine that is faster than yacc and bison and which is both
 reentrant and thread-safe. Furthermore, Lemon implements features
 that can be used to eliminate resource leaks, making is suitable for
 use in long-running programs such as graphical user interfaces or
 embedded controllers.

Package: libapksig-java
Description-md5: 7926f593443c8bc0a39626f9b0442a18
Description-en: library to sign and verify Android APKs
 apksig is a project which aims to simplify APK signing and checking
 whether APK's signatures should verify on Android. apksig supports
 JAR signing (used by Android since day one) and APK Signature Scheme
 v2 (supported since Android Nougat, API Level 24).
 .
 The key feature of apksig is that it knows about differences in APK
 signature verification logic between different versions of the
 Android platform. apksig can thus check whether a signed APK is
 expected to verify on all Android platform versions supported by the
 APK. When signing an APK, apksig will choose the most appropriate
 cryptographic algorithms based on the Android platform versions
 supported by the APK being signed.
 .
 apksig library offers three primitives:
 .
  * ApkSigner which signs the provided APK so that it verifies on all
 Android platform versions supported by the APK. The range of platform
 versions can be customized if necessary.
 .
  * ApkVerifier which checks whether the provided APK is expected to
 verify on all Android platform versions supported by the APK. The
 range of platform versions can be customized if necessary.
 .
  * (Default)ApkSignerEngine which abstracts away signing an APK from
 parsing and building an APK file. This is useful in optimized APK
 building pipelines, such as in Android Plugin for Gradle, which need
 to perform signing while building an APK, instead of after. For
 simpler use cases where the APK to be signed is available upfront,
 the ApkSigner above is easier to use.
 .
 NOTE: Some public classes of the library are in packages having the
 word “internal” in their name. These are not public API of the
 library. Do not use *.internal.* classes directly.

Package: libasm-java
Description-md5: 81f2750bb74d509d011934dac4f76f12
Description-en: Java bytecode manipulation framework
 ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework.
 It can be used to modify existing classes or dynamically generate classes,
 directly in binary form. Provided common transformations and analysis
 algorithms allow one to easily assemble custom complex transformations
 and code analysis tools.
 .
 ASM offer similar functionality as other bytecode frameworks, but it is
 focused on simplicity of use and performance. Because it was designed and
 implemented to be as small and as fast as possible, it makes it very
 attractive for using in dynamic systems.

 BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against
 a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of
 three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first
 algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while
 the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM
 and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split
 alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended
 for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM
 also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina
 reads.

 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end
 based on the LLVM compiler. Its goal is to offer a replacement to the
 GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
 .
 Clang implements all of the ISO C++ 1998, 11 and 14 standards and also
 provides most of the support of C++17.
 .
 This package contains the Clang library.
 .
 The C Interface to Clang provides a relatively small API that exposes
 facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST),
 loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating physical source
 locations with elements within the AST, and other facilities that support
 Clang-based development tools.

Description-en: Lisp dialect for the JVM (library)
 Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual
 Machine. It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the
 approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with
 an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.
 Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode,
 yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is
 supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java
 frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that
 calls to Java can avoid reflection.
 .
 Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data
 philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a
 functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable,
 persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers
 a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that
 ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.

Package: libfuzzer-7-dev
Description-md5: bc55cd127b8dab148b78e61e5e475b8e
Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Description-en: GStreamer editing services (shared library)
 The GStreamer multimedia framework and the accompanying NLE set of
 plugins for non-linear editing offer all the building blocks for:
 * Decoding and encoding to a wide variety of formats, through all the
   available GStreamer plugins.
 * Easily choosing segments of streams and arranging them through time
   through the NLE set of plugins.
 But all those building blocks only offer stream-level access, which
 results in developers who want to write non-linear editors to write a
 consequent amount of code to get to the level of non-linear editing
 notions which are closer and more meaningful for the end-user
 (and therefore the application).
 .
 The GStreamer Editing Services (GES) aims to fill the gap between
 GStreamer/NLE and the application developer by offering a series
 of classes to simplify the creation of many kind of editing-related
 applications.

Package: libgraphics-magick-perl
Description-md5: 694d24fef1105bb316b3f9173117fd3c
Description-en: format-independent image processing - perl interface
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.

 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.

Package: libhibernate-validator-java
Description-md5: 91e0fac9bcd97cc00f06df4d08a7be8d
Description-en: Hibernate Validator
 Hibernate Validator aims at defining and checking a domain model
 level constraints. It supports custom constraints definitions as well
 as full internationalization. Annotations are used to define
 constraints on object level. The validation mechanism can be executed
 in different layers in your application without having to duplicate
 any of these rules (presentation layer, data access layer, Database
 schema).
 .
 Hibernate Validator integrates with Hibernate by applying the
 constraints on the database schema (DDL generation) and by checking
 entity validity before Hibernate inserts or updates instances. You
 can use Hibernate Validator with any Java Persistence provider, not
 only Hibernate, although you will not be able to use automatic DDL
 alteration for constraint generation outside of Hibernate
 EntityManager.

Description-en: Compressed variant of the Java bitset class
 The bit array data structure is implemented in Java as the BitSet class.
 Unfortunately, this fails to scale without compression.
 .
 JavaEWAH is a word-aligned compressed variant of the Java bitset class. It uses
 a 64-bit run-length encoding (RLE) compression scheme. It trades-off some
 compression for better processing speed. It also has a 32-bit version which
 compresses better, but is not as fast.
 .
 In general, the goal of word-aligned compression is not to achieve the best
 compression, but rather to improve query processing time. Hence, the class
 tries to save CPU cycles, maybe at the expense of storage. However, the EWAH
 scheme implemented is always more efficient storage-wise than an uncompressed
 bitmap as implemented in the BitSet class). Unlike some alternatives, javaewah
 does not rely on a patented scheme.

 JBoss Modules is a standalone implementation of a modular (non-hierarchical)
 class loading and execution environment for Java. In other words, rather than
 a single class loader which loads all JARs into a flat class path, each
 library becomes a module which only links against the exact modules it depends
 on, and nothing more. It implements a thread-safe, fast, and highly concurrent
 delegating class loader model, coupled to an extensible module resolution
 system, which combine to form a unique, simple and powerful system for
 application execution and distribution.

Description-md5: 8ae3e8289ca31c4a1de1c3493b56e29b
Description-en: Implementation of JSR 243: Java Data Objects 3.1
 Java Data Objects (JDO) is a standard way to access persistent data in
 databases, using plain old Java objects (POJO) to represent persistent data.
 The approach separates data manipulation (done by accessing Java data members
 in the Java domain objects) from database manipulation (done by calling the
 JDO interface methods). This separation of concerns leads to a high degree of
 independence of the Java view of data from the database view of the data.
 .
 Interfaces are defined for the user's view of persistence:
  - PersistenceManager: the component responsible for the life cycle of
    persistent instances, Query factory, and Transaction access
  - Query: the component responsible for querying the datastore and returning
    persistent instances or values
  - Transaction: the component responsible for initiating and completing
    transactions
 .
 JDO is being developed as a Java Specification Request in the Java Community
 Process. The original JDO 1.0 is JSR-12 http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=12
 and the current JDO 2.0 is JSR-243 http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=243

Package: libobjenesis-java
Description-md5: 41a22df421c52c7dab71183e98808e36
Description-en: Java library to instantiate a new object of a particular class
 Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate a
 new object of a particular class.
 Java already supports this dynamic instantiation of classes using
 Class.newInstance(). However, this only works if the class has an appropriate
 constructor. There are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this
 way, such as when the class contains:
  * Constructors that require arguments.
  * Constructors that have side effects.
  * Constructors that throw exceptions.
 As a result, it is common to see restrictions in libraries stating that
 classes must require a default constructor.
 Objenesis aims to overcomes these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
 on object instantiation.

Description-en: rendering library for openbox themes
 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly. Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.

 extract library profiles that can be used for detection on Android apps.
 .
 Unique features:
 .
   * Library detection resilient against many kinds of bytecode obfuscation.
   * Capability of pinpointing the exact library version (in some cases to a set
     of 2-3 candidate versions).
   * Capability of handling dead-code elimination, by computing a similarity
     score against baseline SDKs.

Description-md5: 6ce316b8b522dda49e8dcffc4eff4eb5
Description-en: Rust standard libraries
 Rust is a curly-brace, block-structured expression language.  It
 visually resembles the C language family, but differs significantly
 in syntactic and semantic details.  Its design is oriented toward
 concerns of "programming in the large", that is, of creating and
 maintaining boundaries - both abstract and operational - that
 preserve large-system integrity, availability and concurrency.

 state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to
 attain this goal there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts
 to deal with:
 .
    * Making the build process easy
    * Providing a uniform build system
    * Providing quality project information
    * Providing guidelines for best practices development
    * Allowing transparent migration to new features

Description-en: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from

Description-en: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.

 Although the class and all methods are public, use of this class is limited
 because only trusted code can obtain instances of it.
 .
 unsafe-mock provides a current version of sun.misc.Unsafe that
 supports all APIs up through the new "fences" API in Java 8 EA builds
 b71 and later. This Unsafe is a copy of the one from Java 8 EA build
 b71, and it is expected that if you want to build against it you put
 it in javac's bootclasspath. You are responsible for determining in
 your own code whether you can access Unsafe and which methods are
 available; this library is only to provide an all-inclusive Unsafe
 against which you can compile using JDKs <= 8.0.

Package: libxstream-java
Description-md5: 10c1dedc8716f96d83e51d094ab4032b
Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.
  - Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output
    formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description-en: OpenStack Neutron Dynamic Routing - Agent
 Neutron provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks.
 These networks connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (such as
 vNICs from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide advanced
 network capabilities, including QoS, ACLs, and network monitoring.
 .
 Neutron dynamic routing enables advertisement of self-service (private)
 network prefixes to physical network devices that support dynamic routing
 protocols such as routers, thus removing the conventional dependency on static
 routes.
 .
 It advertises three classes of routes:
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on non-DVR routers, the
    nexthop is the centralized router.
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on DVR routers, the nexthop is
    the appropriate compute node.
  * Prefix routes for directly routable tenant networks with address scopes,
    the nexthop is the centralized router, the same for DVR and CVR.
 .
 Neutron dynamic routing consists of service plug-in and agent. The service
 plug-in implements the Networking service extension and the agent manages
 dynamic routing protocol peering sessions. The plug-in communicates with the
 agent through RPC.

  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on DVR routers, the nexthop is
    the appropriate compute node.
  * Prefix routes for directly routable tenant networks with address scopes,
    the nexthop is the centralized router, the same for DVR and CVR.

Description-md5: b9824fd7fa1117c50a721069422237ef
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.

Package: tcpflow
Description-md5: 8b5d860e2da32a9ce8f2c9689abca505
Description-en: TCP flow recorder
 tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
 connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient
 for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
 summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the
 data that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow
 reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a
 separate file for later analysis.
 .
 tcpflow understands sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct
 data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.
 However, it currently does not understand IP fragments; flows
 containing IP fragments will not be recorded properly.
 .
 tcpflow is based on the LBL Packet Capture Library and therefore
 supports the same rich filtering expressions that programs like
 'tcpdump' support. tcpflow can also rebuild flows from data captured
 with 'tcpdump -w'.

 This package provides a program that can be used to clean out temporary-file
 directories.  It recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir()
 across symlinks, and removes files that haven't been accessed in a
 user-specified amount of time.  You can specify a set of files to protect
 from deletion with a shell pattern.  It will not remove files owned by the
 process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like
 `rm -f'.  `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special
 files unless given a command line option enabling it to.
 .
 WARNING:  Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'.  There are no protections
 against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from
 functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment.
 .
 The daily tmpreaper run can be configured through /etc/tmpreaper.conf .

Description-en: View-OS in user space - ext2 module for UMFUSE
 View-OS is a novel approach to the process/kernel interface.  The semantics of
 each system call can be assigned process by process giving the user the right
 to decide which view of the system each process has to join.  Each process can
 "see" a different file system structure, networking resources, processor,
 devices.  Moreover some of the resources can be provided by the user
 him/herself, thus these resource can be private to the single process and are
 not known a priori by the system.  Groups of processes can share the same view
 but this is just an optimization to share management methods.
 .
 For more information, see http://wiki.virtualsquare.org
 .
 UMView is a user-mode implementation of View-OS.  Processes are run with a
 controlling daemon that captures all the system calls (at present using the
 ptrace() system call) and uses dynamically loadable modules to change their
 semantic.
 .
 This package contains a sub-module for umfuse.  umfuse is contained in the
 main UMView package and allows almost complete source compatibility with FUSE
 modules.  umfuseext2 can be used to mount Extended 2 file system images
 inside an UMView instance.
