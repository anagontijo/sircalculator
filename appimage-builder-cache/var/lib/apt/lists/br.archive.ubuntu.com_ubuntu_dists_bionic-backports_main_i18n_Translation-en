Package: dh-autoreconf
Description-md5: 64431da0ae4318a5fbf441743bd5ffc5
Description-en: debhelper add-on to call autoreconf and clean up after the build
 dh-autoreconf provides a debhelper sequence addon named 'autoreconf' and two
 commands, dh_autoreconf and dh_autoreconf_clean.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf command creates a list of the files and their checksums,
 calls autoreconf and then creates a second list for the new files.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf_clean command compares these two lists and removes all
 files which have been added or changed (files may be excluded if needed).
 .
 For CDBS users, a rule is provided to call the dh-autoreconf programs at
 the right time.
